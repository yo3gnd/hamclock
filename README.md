# HamClock Client

This repository is the primary source for ongoing maintenance of the HamClock Client,
aka the HamClock "frontend", and often just referred to as "HamClock".

It is intended as a reference implementation for use with backend servers
that are compatible with the original Clear Sky Institute service and the evolving backend standards
being developed by the [Open Hamclock Standards](https://github.com/openhamclock/hamclock-standards) project.

See [doc](./doc/) for all the information and documentation related to installing, using, and developing HamClock.

The HamClock Client was originally created by Clear Sky Institute, and made available under an [MIT License](./LICENSE).
This repository was started with the source code for Clear Sky Institute's HamClock v4.22, the final version they created.

An archive of historical HamClock Client releases up to 4.22 is available at <https://github.com/openhamclock/hamclock-client-archive>.

This fork also carries a few changes by YO3GND which reduce CPU load in the desktop/web build without slowing background polling or delaying map-visible updates. The practical result is that you can leave it running in Docker without the machine sounding as though it is preparing for take-off, and use something else to warm the room.

To check it out, run `docker run -d --name hamclock -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 8082:8082 yo3gnd/hamclock:latest`.
